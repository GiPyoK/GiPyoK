# Creating Portfolio with Publish by John Sundell

I first built my portfolio website with basic HTML and CSS. It was my first attempt at creating a website and it looked ugly. While I was browsing through various libraries to enhance the look and maintainability of my portfolio, I stumbled upon a library called [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) by John Sundell. Publish is a static site generator built for Swift developers. I thought this would be a good tool to make my portfolio website and be a fun challenge to learn about it.

Now let's get started.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish.git
$ cd Publish
$ make
$ mkdir GiPyoJohnKim
$ cd GiPyoJohnKim
$ publish new
```

After running these lines of code in the terminal, I was ready to create my website.
