It was my first attempt at creating a website and it looked ugly. While I was browsing through various libraries to enhance the look and maintainability of my portfolio, I stumbled upon a library called <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a> by John Sundell. Publish is a static site generator built for Swift developers. I thought this would be a good tool to make my portfolio website and be a fun challenge to learn about it.</p><p>Now let's get started.</p><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish.git
$ cd Publish
$ make
$ mkdir GiPyoJohnKim
$ cd GiPyoJohnKim
$ publish new
</code></pre><p>After running these lines of code in the terminal, I was ready to create my website.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://gipyojohnkim.com/projects/first-post</guid><title>My first post</title><description>A description of my first post.</description><link>https://gipyojohnkim.com/projects/first-post</link><pubDate>Thu, 7 Jan 2021 10:34:00 -0800</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My first post</h1><p>My first post's text.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
